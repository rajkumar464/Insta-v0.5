# Instagram v0.5

This project is a clone of the [Instagram](https://instagram.com) web app. It has been built using ReactJS and is hooked up to Firebase.
Features range from signing up to uploading posts, and adding comments to posts.

This project served the purpose of helping me understand how a full-stack web application can be fleshed out and bolstered by a PaaS like Google Firebase. Thank you to the several sources of inspiration spread across the Internet.
